# OrthoMate: Knee Osteoarthritis Detection and Severity Prediction ü¶¥üîç

Welcome to the GitHub repository of OrthoMate, a web application developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the Flask framework. OrthoMate is designed for knee osteoarthritis detection and severity prediction, utilizing the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for image analysis.

## Description

OrthoMate is a state-of-the-art web application that aids in the early detection and severity prediction of knee osteoarthritis. By incorporating deep learning algorithms and machine learning techniques, OrthoMate assists healthcare professionals and patients in making informed decisions and personalized treatment plans.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluating OrthoMate contains a total of 1,656 images, categorized into five classes: Moderate, Mild, Severe, Normal, and Doubtful. The dataset can be accessed from the following link: [OrthoMate Dataset](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/t9ndx37v5h/1).

## Key Features

- **Knee Osteoarthritis Detection:** OrthoMate uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to detect knee osteoarthritis from medical images, allowing for early diagnosis and intervention.
- **Severity Prediction:** The application utilizes machine learning algorithms to predict the severity of knee osteoarthritis, enabling clinicians to assess the condition's progression and recommend appropriate treatment strategies.
- **Web-based Interface:** OrthoMate offers a user-friendly web interface, making it accessible to medical professionals and patients from any device with an internet connection.
- **Efficient and Accurate:** The CNN-based approach ensures high accuracy and efficiency in analyzing medical data for osteoarthritis detection and severity prediction.
